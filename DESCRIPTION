Description: GBScleanR is a package for quality check, filtering, and error 
   correction of genotype data derived from next generation sequcener (NGS)
   based genotyping platforms. GBScleanR takes Variant Call Format (VCF) file as
   input. The main function of this package is `estGeno()` which estimates the 
   true genotypes of samples from given read counts for genotype markers using a
   hidden Markov model with incorporating uneven observation ratio of allelic 
   reads. This implementation gives robust genotype estimation even in noisy 
   genotype data usually observed in Genotyping-By-Sequnencing (GBS) and similar
   methods, e.g. RADseq. The current implementation accepts genotype data of a 
   diploid population at any generation of multi-parental cross, e.g. biparental
   F2 from inbred parents, biparental F2 from outbred parents, and 8-way 
   recombinant inbred lines (8-way RILs) which can be refered to as MAGIC 
   population.
